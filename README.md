## About the Project
**PROJET-MLA** aims to provide an end-to-end solution for [add specific use case or problem statement] using machine learning algorithms. It demonstrates how data can be:
1. **Collected** from various sources,
2. **Cleaned** and processed,
3. **Analyzed** using common ML models or statistical techniques,
4. **Visualized** for meaningful insights.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the materials here to help with your own projects or learning journey.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and formatting raw data.
- **Model Training**: Examples and templates for training standard ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Methods for assessing model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- **Visualization**: Simple plots and charts to interpret results effectively.
